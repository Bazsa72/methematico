Simple card game I've learned in elementary.
It's basically a modified version of Poker Patience.
You draw a card, place it on the grid, and try to form some basic poker hands, except, suits don't play a role here.

# Scoring:

Pair 1

Three of a kind 6

Four of a kind 16   Four aces 20

Two pair 3

Straight 12

Full house 10

Royal 8

# Additional Info:

Suits don't matter.

A 'Royal' is 1 10 11 12 13.

Diagonals have a x2 multiplier.
